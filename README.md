### Qustions : let and var and const
#### -main diffrance is that let is blocked scoped and var is not blocked scoped. {...}
####  -we can declare variable multiple times with var but not with let or const
      note : we can access parent block level inside child block level
###  Qustions : Hoisting    
#### Hoisting mean java script moves the variables on the top when execute any file. but you can do it with var only with let you will get an error.
